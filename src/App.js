            <p className="lead">Canadian boy admits he dearly misses Violeta, a beautiful spanish girl he met on a rooftop back in 2019. "I hope she's doing well. It's been a long time since we've seen eachother, so i'm always wondering what she's up to."</p>
            <p>The pair had plans of existing together in Amsterdam this year that got derailed by a stupid ass pandemic. With distance and unanswered questions, they started to drift apart until the boy no longer knew what Violeta was feeling.</p>
            <p>"I get so lost in my mind sometimes. We talked on the phone in September and decided to drift until the pandemic was over. I can imagine us drifting through space but we're so far apart. I long for a day when our space paths cross again."</p>
            <p>Not knowing when their paths may cross again, the pair communicates rarely. Regardless, the boy's heart continues to sing a song for the girl. Waiting for the day they might reunite.</p>

            <p>It hurts different:</p>

            <p>There isn't a person i've met quite like you</p>
            <p>Out of 10 billion, noone else will do.</p>
            <p>You're a flower, a path, a marathon ribbon</p>
            <p>a shower, a laugh, that much is given.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Imagine defined, a life laid ahead</p>
            <p>with iced coffees, and you in a bed.</p>
            <p>Together explore, the cosmos, the trittens</p>
            <p>Chaos ensues, that much is given.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>my heart hurts cause there's a girl out there</p>
            <p>with love in her eyes, and flowers in her hair</p>
